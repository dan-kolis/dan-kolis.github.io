Heads up - Dan K and building technology

In 2018 I hit upon the notion of an improvement to HVAC that involved both
lighting and air, primarily old world HVAC concern of temperature.

Since then I've been part of rolling out 4 PCb's for HVAC Fan controls, deployed in maybe a five or six
buildings in Toronto and New York City. The following is in Chronological order "roughly".

   **Ten HVAC PCBs we made - ready to "Break out"**

Of course there is a Engineering company in this story someplace; but lets focus on the idea, the stuff
deployed more then who beyond myself. That is, communication is **about the idea and the stuff**, 
not me, **or the other people and companies**...


Goals of the notion
******************************
The goal of this is a system that has the following attributes:

• **Energy conservation** - Possibly the savings "across the board" might aspire to 15% less for commercial buildings which include residential, office and retail spaces.

• **High comfort levels** - Distributed interaction would hope to make generally the spaces more responsive to desires of people quite directly.

• **Less switchgear** - The "fuseboxes", (correctly called panelboards), nearly dissappear completely from the wiring systems.

• **Use "Dirty" power** - Many subsystem coudl defer loads, ( for exampel, heat/cool, fans ) for many seconds, generally power could be added any old way to Low Voltage distribution, even tolerating short outages. 

• **Configurable switching** - CHanges to how things work is all turned into line items is some file, no wiring changes to change switches, occupancy sensors for lightingm, etc.
