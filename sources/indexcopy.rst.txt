Heads up - Dan K and building technology

In 2018 I hit upon the notion of an improvement to HVAC that involved both
lighting and air, primarily old world HVAC concern of temperature.

Since then I've been part of rolling out 4 PCb's for HVAC Fan controls, deployed in maybe a five or six
buildings in Toronto and New York City. The following is in Chronological order "roughly".

   **Ten HVAC PCBs we made - ready to "Break out"**

Of course there is a Engineering company in this story someplace; but lets focus on the idea, the stuff
deployed more then who beyond myself. That is, communication is **about the idea and the stuff**, 
not me, **or the other people and companies**...
