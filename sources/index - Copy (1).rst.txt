==============================================
Heads up - Dan K and building technology
==============================================


This heading has asterisks under it
*******************************************
I think this one was posted to my Dan K Cloud thing for a Teleconf show 
and tell on 23 Nov 2020. Since then I fixed some spelling errors, etc; 
And a little first try at versioning too...

:ref:`compBioOp9p63`

Nothing matters as much as the **index.html page** for the first impression, 
so probably its always a sacred, hand fussed over. usually edited a little, file.

This *doesn't* mean its endlessly clobbered, lost and rekeyed.
It means the people doing the work, should decide and do something to make this
compatible with what their doing; For instance: Just setting a 
believed in index.html to **read only**, so its
persists, or have a script copy it over... fixes this issue...

But its a generalized thing to be managed.

This heading has hyphens under it
---------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the endlessly tweaked single .rst to .html file of how the compile makes 
effects, and so on:

:ref:`Using_sphinx_worked_examples`

  Note: Its **intentionally** referred with a label, not the heading itself, so
  if you make a boo boo and lose the conf.py file it will stll connect.

    **The conf.py file is important !**

  The worked example file has 'real adult' rev control, the rest of the heap of
  files here doesn't. versioning in conf.py doesn't really seem to be exposed a
  lot in reality. its set to 0.0.1 to imply its not doing anything yet.

In case the conf.py with the id of this work, etc a few changed lines gets lost,
a **backup** file is named: conf.ImaBackupFile


Jump table to alternatives
--------------------------
Here's a short list of 'top level like' files as links for you to enjoy

**Of course** Titles are duplicated and there are ones with syntax errors 
and "dunno" here and there. There dont have HTML:// yet as there not published
to a real server, but the chaining is the same and local authoring is a lot
more efficient then endless round trips to servers !

Index XX links of all sorts
*****************************
A heap of bunch of messy tries at the top level indexing concepts:
:ref:`index01`
:ref:`index02`
:ref:`index03`
:ref:`index04`
:ref:`index05`
:ref:`index06`
:ref:`index07`
:ref:`index08`
:ref:`index09`
:ref:`index10`
:ref:`index11`
:ref:`index12`
:ref:`index13`
:ref:`index14`
:ref:`index15`
:ref:`index16`
:ref:`index17`
:ref:`index18`
:ref:`index19`

This is probably a good number of these to leave lurking around 
for thinking and testing.
Just clobber any one you think is stupid or has proved its point 'as you go'.
Of course their in no specific order.

Then the one that's 'really magically right' might be copied over index.html

**OR**

You use some other redirection concept on your server, and its HTML rewrites 
so you generate the right user experience, and leave yourself with one a one line
change for pointing to entire WWW sets, in case of mistakes, ass on fire fixes,
etc.

This is *Not* official version control. its just well, when I did it as they say
in **ISO 9000** it's for **Reference only**, whatever that is suppose to mean
nobody knows exactly...
