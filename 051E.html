<h1>Welcome ! Let's discuss Interactive Sciences<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-let-s-discuss-interactive-sciences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I'd like to thank <strong>Karen Donoghue</strong> for exposing me; Dan Kolis, to this
commercial opportunity. That E-mail was posted on 04 Nov 2021: I'm sorry
I didn't answer sooner; After a few hours researching your offering(s)
in  processes, I had to think about it, then write up this memo.</p>
<p>After a little research I concluded it's a perfectly clear case
when sciencey innovation with large scale R&amp;D turns the corner
into a technology that is ready to be deployed. Wow !</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Iterative Scopes is pioneering development of AI-driven computational tools in gastroenterology, a field that has not yet benefited from advanced precision medicine technologies.  The aim is to improve GI drug development and clinical care.
Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to analyze and interpret digital images and videos.</p>
</div>
<p>Techniques within the field of computer-vision include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>​Detection – Determining when an object is present in an image / video</p></li>
<li><p>Localization – Defining where exactly an object is with an image / video</p></li>
<li><p>Segmentation – Classification of where an object is at the pixel level</p>
<p>The company is applying these techniques to endoscopy videos that assist
physicians in comprehensively documenting all the relevant clinical
features that exist for a patient.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the link for the company in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>My perception, (which maybe quite incorrect), is the Cambridge
side technology for working with machine vision is far enough
along it's time to &quot;get after&quot; implementing the science in a somewhat
deployable piece of routine technology. If the algorithms/programs are
the crown jewels of the company, then the peripheral aspects need to
be completed to make a user ready system.</p>
<p>The notion here is creating a custom device platform to do this in real
time is utterly unavoidable. Thast the M.L. and so on needs to be actionable
in a clinical setting. Exporting images and post processing is significant,
but it doesn't either demonstrate the science component in it's best
light or move to a testing/confirmation product cycle.
Even a goal of a patent portfolio needs to be reconciled with
the solution(s) implemented in more of an appliance modality then a
software release using images from other instrumentation in non-real time.</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div></blockquote>
<p>The strong suggestion is that design and fabrication of a single board
computer, housing, documentation and liasion for conformance engineering
is a good fit for a small company which exists expressly for what
electronics industries people call <strong>short runs.</strong> Specifically,
the suggestion is a &quot;real employee&quot; is a step as opposed to achieving
a milestone, that to make a real device a facility is required, not a
single person. How capable they are, or experienced, etc. is not even
particularly relevant.</p>
<p>The need is to get something made--so who
actually does that is more of a game changer then how it's decided.</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>Specifications Considered</strong></p><p>How it's specified is a tricky question. In the old days, the notion
was that such a specification is a &quot;moon shot&quot; in management terms.
Now, open source software and the stability of computer solutions
means the specification needs to exceed minimums, not normalize
to expected functionality. If, for instance human factors is
leaving a practitioner unhappy, this should be easy to improve
before the next usage session. Other software support approaches
in other fields are instructive. For example:
weapons systems programs are frequently now &quot;touched up&quot; between
firings ! The idea changing <strong>most</strong> programs is a big deal, is
bad-old-school nowadays, entirely. Getting a few particular things
wrong in this process is incredibly serious, but
the majority of line items are fixed with a little typing and some clicks.
If the minimums were exceeded on the first pass, the fixes are trivial.</p>

Making the red interface area exist means any future look and feel
is easy. There is no R&amp;D. This is about relatively little specification;
the functionality is easy to make exceed the medium term needs with ease.</p>
<p>A little more about each subsystem. Again, there is a hardware and
software component to each. However endless open source code is

<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">HDTV [ interface ]</p>
<p>Two outputs are suggested as a baseline. One for viewing the primary
medical activity, and the second for displaying menu like options as a
reminder. My baseline notion is that most real time changes are simply
spoken; but a reminder of what they are is useful. This would be
provisioned with a small screen for the menu and the large one is
up to the site to supply/configure.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">I/O Probe [ interface ]</p>
<p>The probe subsystem interface is really the deal breaker on justifying
a custom board. That is, some 19 inch rack with plug-ins might be
enough for some, if not all, business and science goals. But adding
in the need for the probes takes it out of the ballpark of a
routine solution entirely. The interface should be a separable
PCB entirely to accommodate different manufacturer probes and have
an ARM9 CPU on the little board with the custom connector(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">I/O Vital Signs [ Interface ]</p>
<p>Its probably useful to make the diagnostic environment possibly quite
stand-alone, so an interface for a cuff for blood pressure and
galvanic skin resistance for heart rate is worth provisioning.
Of course a software easy option is to disable these. Doing so
is not quite trivial, it involves synchronization with other
devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">AUDIO</p>
<p>Audio input from the environment via microphone(s) is essential.
It is likely the human interface will lean into the ability to
speak keywords. Also, audio transcripts from the Doctor in
attendance is obvious. Bluetooth wireless and/or wired with
a few common connectors is the obvious implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">WORLD</p>
<p>The term &quot;World&quot; is used in some IoT vocabulary to mean both networks
and gateways to internet. Of course this device will have some
implementation allowing remote access which is much like being
on site with the patient, as well as replays of various kinds.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Slick, easy to change multi-lingual machine interfaces that create
a device that allows remote access, forensic traceability and passes
international approvals can be a troubling and even deceiving process.
The ultimate quality of solutions is application of the
understanding of the diseases,
interventions and injection of common sense based on the patient.
Doing this packaging of that medical science with great computer
science, does not make a perfect,
or even necessarily adequate solution. The deeper M.L. graphs and
ancillary reasoning in the programs, are absolutely pivotal.</p>

<h2>Welcome to Computer On a Module (COM) fabrications<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-computer-on-a-module-com-fabrications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reality of making a system with a powerful computer in it
&quot;from scratch&quot;, no longer exists. All the alternative fabrication
ideas re-use prebuilt plug-able components. This makes the system
incredibly easier to fabricate, both faster and cheaper to first
application. Shown is a reasonably powerful pluggable Computer
on Module (COM), which might be a good try for the device considered
here. A COM means future upgrades are trivial, new and better modules
that are interchangeable are always in the pipeline.</p>
<p>All the incredible delays to train data do not apply to using it.
The computer support still has to be fast, but not as remarkably fast
as the computers used in development.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>There is a standards list in this URL.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>However</strong> There is a serious complication ! Selecting a standard that
fails strands not only the buying decisions but obsoletes the so
called custom &quot;carrier board&quot; totally. Whether the units are going to
and from trade shows, are in conformance testing with customers or
W.H.O. type phased trials, or other critical application situations ...
having the standard go out of fashion totally is disruptive and
invariably expensive. This occurs over years, not months, but it has
some near but not quite: &quot;scrap and rework&quot;, of both hardware,
software and obsoletes inventories. A change along these lines is sure
to have impact at FDA approvals too.</p>
<p>A management process should realize picking this &quot;horse to ride&quot; is a
subtle, difficult decision to get right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-interface">
<h2>Software interface<a class="headerlink" href="#software-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The acceptance procedure for a system &quot;board&quot; for this purposes is based
primarily on the software interfaces. Using a COM module, the board
will boot up running linux and run programs, that is not the
acceptance criteria whatsoever.</p>
<p>I suggest almost all the the firmware s/w entities be part of the board
offering, that the addition of the <strong>&quot;Science module&quot;</strong> is to
drop the M.L. A.I. into a system running a well characterized
test version that is an already complete placeholder. This is
to insure the R&amp;D and conformance process people are not stuck with
version control and driver problems.</p>
<p>Clearly, imaging the alimentary canal, processing images and developing
helpful directives for people via perfect looking documentation is
difficult. But another reason to have a division of responsibility in
the system as built versus science add-in's is in the science part, the
mapping from images to characterization to decisions, with both people
and M.L. A.I. systems, is subject to incremental improvement of a
fundamentally impossible to predict nature.</p>
<p>A casual plan for improvements like so: &quot;Only the data will change,
the future improvements will not change the running code&quot;, is almost
never true. So clobbering some of the content of a specific apparatus
to upgrade it needs considerable confidence the rest of the thing is
software stable.</p>

</div>
<p>The goal might be something around <strong>7 submissions / second</strong> to the
M.L. A.I. subsystem. My general observation is incredibly obvious really;
All images submitted should be prioritized, so in principle every frame is
a fact to be scanned into the report generation and human review process.
Undoubtedly an extensive vocabulary from the M.L. A.I. group exists now.</p>
<p>Details like adjusting illumination should be best handled by the M.L. A.I.
subsystem, but the board support is still enabled to discard some images.</p>
<p>The linux only SBC needs a solid state drive and an old fashioned
mechanical one. Sizes to be determined. So a HD failure doesn't lose
the session, a copy of everything is stored either in a removable USB
stick or &quot;someplace else&quot;. The session can be encrypted and signed.
These details are out of the scope of this document, but the hardware
must obviously be capable of this trivial support. Of course it's much
better to store the backups in R/T offsite, so the encryption needs to
be &quot;bulletproof&quot; so it can be poked into the cloud without privacy
people problems.</p>

<p>Each line item needs rigorous version control. At the earliest &quot;touch&quot;
as a process to apply these programs, a forensic trail needs to be
constructed for various, ongoing approvals. Each program should have
multiple settable criteria, and one for each must be <strong>harder to pass</strong>
then the application. This involves speeds, how it renders
